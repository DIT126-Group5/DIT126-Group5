# Book of Bliss

### Description
Books of Bliss is a platform where users can buy and/or sell books and course literature. When a user puts up a book for sale, it needs to specify a price and a condition of the book. Other users can then proceed to buy this listing, provided that they have enough credits in their account balance.

# Good to know

- At the start there will be no listings available so you need to register an account and publish to sell a book.
- You can use this ISBN: "9780134092669" as a example test to get a book to sell.
- Then you have to make another account in order to buy the book because the same account can not buy its own book.
